			<h1>Accessibility statement for NHS profile manager</h1>
			<p>This accessibility statement applies to the <a href="https://organisation.nhswebsite.nhs.uk/">NHS profile manager</a>.</p>
			<p>We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
			<ul class="nhsuk-list--bullet">
				<li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
				<li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
				<li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard </li>
				<li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of VoiceOver, Jaws, NVDA) </li>
				<li>skip to repeated content</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
			<p>AbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

			<h2>How accessible this website is</h2>
			<p>We know from several accessibility audits that parts of this website are not fully accessible.</p>
			<p>Some parts of the website have an illogical focus order which includes the 'Skip to main content' link not behaving as expected.</p> 
			<p>Form errors are currently being displayed at incorrect times. This also included errors displaying placeholder text which does not conform to colour contrast requirements.</p>
			
			<h2>What to do if you cannot access parts of this website</h2>
			<p>If you need information on this website in a different format like accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille, contact: <a href="mailto:nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net">nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net</a>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Reporting accessibility problems with this website</h2>
			<p>We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact: <a href="mailto:nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net">nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>Enforcement procedure</h2>
			<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/" rel="noopener">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>
					
			<h2>Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
			<p>NHS UK is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
			<p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>
			
			<h2>Non accessible content</h2>
			<p>The content listed below is non accessible for the following reasons.</p>
			
			<h3>Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
			<h4>Forms</h4>
			<p>Errors are currently being displayed at incorrect times (Error identification 3.3.1)</p>
			<h4>Keyboard navigation</h4>
			<p>Currently there is a 'Skip to main content' link however due to issues with focus order this currently does not have expected behaviour (Bypass blocks 2.4.1)</p>
			<p>When navigating by keyboard only, the focus order is not in an order that preserves meaning and operability. Dynamic content is regularly loaded in which modifies users current focus state (Focus order 2.4.3)</p>
			<h4>Content visibility</h4>
			<p>When in the non-NHSmail route and a user receives an error, each input adds a placeholder which fails colour contrast (Contrast (minimum) 1.4.3)</p>
			
			<h3>Disproportionate burden</h3>
			<p>Currently you are unable to login without the use of JavaScript. Due to using a third-party tool for our login process, we are unable to rectify this issue.</p>
			<p>This third-party tool also limits out ability to modify page markup, which means the issues listed above currently cannot be resolved.</p>
			
			<h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
			<p>This statement was prepared on 29 October 2021.</p>
			<p>This website was last tested on 29 October 2021. The test was carried out by NHS UK Frontend developers.</p>
			<p>This website's accessibility will be reviewed on a regular basis. We will update this accessibility statement with any relevant changes.</p>
