      <p>Two days ago I had the roots from a molar removed, which I was dreading, and i couldn't believe how quick and painless the whole procedure was. My dentist had removed the molar which had broken but the dentist couldn't get the roots out. I was referred to High Ash to see the dental surgeon and I was very impressed and now I am pain free. I can't thank you enough.</p>
