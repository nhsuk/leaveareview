			<h1>Accessibility statement for the NHS profile manager</h1>
			<p>This accessibility statement applies to the <a href="https://organisation.nhswebsite.nhs.uk/">NHS profile manager</a>.</p>
			<p>We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. This means you should be able to:</p>
			<ul class="nhsuk-list--bullet">
				<li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser functionality</li>
				<li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
				<li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard </li>
				<li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
				<li>interact with most of the website using a screen reader (including recent versions of Jaws, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We also try to make the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
			<p>If you have a disability, <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use</a>.</p>

			<h2>How accessible this website is</h2>
			<p>We know from several accessibility audits that parts of this website are not fully accessible.</p>
			<p>Some parts of the website have an illogical focus order which includes the 'Skip to main content' link not behaving as expected.</p> 
			<p>Form errors are currently being displayed at incorrect times. This also includes errors displaying placeholder text which does not conform to colour contrast requirements.</p>
			<p>We are actively working to address these issues as part of an ongoing programme to improve the accessibility of this website.</p>
			
			<h2>Reporting accessibility problems with this website</h2>
			<p>We are always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, email <a href="mailto:nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net">nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>Enforcement procedure</h2>
			<p>If you are not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/" rel="noopener">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>
			<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’).</p>
					
			<h2>Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>
			<p>NHS.UK is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
			<h3>Compliance status</h3>
			<p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>
			
			<h3>Non-accessible content</h3>
			<p>The content that is not accessible is listed below, together with an explanation.</p>
			
			<h4>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h4>
			<h5>Forms</h5>
			<ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
				<li>Errors are currently being displayed at incorrect times (Error Identification 3.3.1)</li>
				<li>Users are not always notified when conditionally revealed content associated with a radio button is expanded or collapsed (Name, Role, Value 4.1.2)</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Keyboard navigation</h5>
			<ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
				<li>The 'Skip to main content' link does not behave as expected, due to issues with the focus order (Bypass Blocks 2.4.1)</li>
				<li>When navigating by keyboard, the focus order is not in the correct sequence. It is not in an order that preserves meaning and operability. Dynamic content is also regularly loaded in, which modifies the users' current focus state (Focus Order 2.4.3)</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Content visibility</h5>
			<ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
				<li>If you get an error in the non-NHSmail route, the placeholder copy fails colour contrast requirements (Contrast Minimum 1.4.3).</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Disproportionate burden</h3>
			<p>You are currently unable to log in without the use of JavaScript. We are unable to fix this issue, as we use a 3rd-party tool for our login process.</p>
			<p>This 3rd-party tool also limits our ability to modify page markup, which means the issues listed above cannot currently be resolved.</p>
			
			<h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
			<p>This statement was prepared on 2 November 2021.</p>
			<p>This website was last tested on 29 October 2021. The test was carried out by NHS.UK frontend developers.</p>
			<p>This website's accessibility will be reviewed on a regular basis. We will update this accessibility statement with any relevant changes.</p>
